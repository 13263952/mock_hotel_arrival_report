# Hotel Reports - Tabular Printing

![Hotel Reports](hotel-reports.png)
## Introduction

This repository contains tools for generating and printing hotel reports in a tabular format. It includes two Jupyter Notebooks (`last_name_alphabetized.ipynb` and `loyalty_breakfast.ipynb`) that demonstrate how to organize guest data and print reports efficiently. The reports are designed to save attendants time by eliminating the need to manually sort through names with small letters in front of the guest's last name and avoid displaying room numbers along with the last names.

## Files

### Jupyter Notebooks:

1. `last_name_alphabetized.ipynb`: This notebook shows how to organize the guest list in alphabetical order by last name, allowing attendants to find guests easily without showing room numbers.

2. `loyalty_breakfast.ipynb`: Here, we demonstrate generating a report for guests with a "Gold" loyalty level, making it convenient for staff to prepare breakfast lists efficiently.

### Data Files:

- `guest_list.txt`: This tab-separated text file contains the arrival report with guest details like "Guest Name," "Arrival Date," "Room Number," "Payment Status," "Length of Stay," "Purpose of Stay," "Loyalty Level," "Departure Date," and "Index ID."

- `last_name_alphabetized_Jul-24-23.txt`: This text file contains the output of the "last_name_alphabetized.ipynb" notebook. It presents the guest list in tabular form, sorted alphabetically by last name without displaying room numbers.

- `loyalty_breakfast_Jul-24-23.txt`: This text file contains the output of the "loyalty_breakfast.ipynb" notebook. It shows the guests with "Gold" loyalty level in tabular format for efficient breakfast preparation.

## How It Saves Time

Printing reports in a tabular format has several advantages, especially when dealing with a large number of guests:

1. **Easy Access**: Reports organized alphabetically by last name allow attendants to quickly find specific guests, avoiding the need to search through the entire list.

2. **Improved Privacy**: By not displaying room numbers along with the last names, the reports offer improved privacy for guests.

3. **Efficient Preparation**: The "loyalty_breakfast.ipynb" notebook filters guests by their loyalty level, enabling attendants to generate specific reports for tasks like breakfast preparation without manual sorting.

4. **Visual Clarity**: The tabular layout enhances readability and reduces the risk of human error in data interpretation.

5. **Time Efficiency**: The provided reports can be easily printed and distributed, saving attendants valuable time during their daily tasks.

## Conclusion

By adopting tabular printing techniques for hotel reports, attendants can save time and improve overall efficiency. These reports facilitate quick access to guest information and streamline specific tasks like preparing breakfast lists for guests with special loyalty levels. With organized and visually clear reports, attendants can provide a better guest experience and ensure smooth hotel operations while maintaining guest privacy.
